Summary:
Nicholas - Made code for the time conversion functions and reading input from
the file.

Makenzie - Made code for storing input data and properly formatting the output.

Overall we both spent about an equal amount of time brainstorming and testing 
ways to store the input data outside of our scheduled meetings. We held 3 
meetings, each lasting 2-3 hours, to discuss how to implement certain parts 
of the code. Also, whenever we had an idea that we were unsure of, we would
try testing our code before pushing to ensure that the project files
stayed organized.
